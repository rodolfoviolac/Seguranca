    THERE ARE TWO BASIC TYPES OF CRYPTOGRAPHY TECHNIQUES SECRET KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY
    USES JUST A SINGLE KEY THE SENDER APPLIES A KEY TO ENCRYPT A MESSAGE WHILE THE
    RECEIVER APPLIES THE SAME KEY TO DECRYPT THE MESSAGE SINCE ONLY SINGLE KEY
    IS USED SO WE SAY THAT THIS IS A SYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION THE BIGGEST PROBLEM
    WITH THIS TECHNIQUE IS THE DISTRIBUTION OF KEY AS THIS ALGORITHM MAKES USE
    OF SINGLE KEY FOR ENCRYPTION OR DECRYPTION PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY
    INVOLVES TWO KEY CRYPTOSYSTEM IN WHICH A SECURE COMMUNICATION CAN TAKE
    PLACE BETWEEN RECEIVER AND SENDER OVER A INSECURE COMMUNICATION CHANNEL
    SINCE A PAIR OF KEYS IS APPLIED HERE SO THIS TECHNIQUE IS ALSO KNOWN AS
    ASYMMETRIC ENGRYPTION IN THIS METHOD EACH PARTY HAS A PRIVATE KEY AND A
    PUBLIC KEY THE PRIVATE IS SECRET AND IS NOT REVEALED WHILE THE PUBLIC
    KEY IS SHARED WITH ALL THOSE WHOM YOU WANT TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE NEXT
    QUIZ USES PERMUTATION AND IT IS KNOWN THAT THE TEXT FITS PERFECTLY IN A
    RECTANGULAR AREA WHERE THE NUMBER OF ROWS IS GREATER THAN THE NUMBER OF
    COLUMNS IT IS ALSO KNOWN THAT THE WORD BANANA APPEARS IN THE TEXT
